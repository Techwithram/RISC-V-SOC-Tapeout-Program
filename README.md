Welcome to my documentation of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by VSD**   
This repository gives  the **overview** of my weekly tasks through this Journey, with each week maintained in a **separate GitHub repository** and the overall progress will be shared here.

"From RTL to GDSII, we design silicon step by step, mastering open-source tools and contributing to India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative."

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each week has its own dedicated repo:

## 📅 Week 0 — Tools Setup

📌 **Focus:** Installing and verifying the open-source EDA toolchain on Ubuntu 22.04  

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Yosys** | RTL Synthesis | ✅ Installed |
| **Icarus Verilog** | Simulation & Testbench | ✅ Installed |
| **GTKWave** | Waveform Viewer | ✅ Installed |
| **Ngspice** | Circuit Simulation | ✅ Installed |
| **Magic** | Layout & DRC | ✅ Installed |
| **OpenLane** | Complete RTL → GDSII Flow | ✅ Installed |

### 🌟 Key Learnings
- Set up the **EDA toolchain** successfully on Ubuntu 22.04.  
- Understood the **importance of each tool** in the RTL-to-GDSII flow.  
- Verified environment with **sample test runs**.  
- Prepared ground for **Week 1 RTL design tasks**.
