Welcome to my documentation of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by VSD**   
This repository gives  the **overview** of my weekly tasks through this Journey, with each week maintained in a **new and unique GitHub repository** and the overall progress will be shared here.

_"Right from Market analysis, spec to GDSII, we design and manufacture silicon step by step, that too while mastering open-source tools and taking part in India's Semiconductor Mission through a great opportunity given by VSD team and most importantly learning the indusrtial flow as an engineer."_

## 📅 Week 0 — Tools Setup

📌 **Focus:** Installing and verifying the open-source EDA toolchain on Ubuntu 22.04  

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Yosys** | RTL Synthesis | ✅ Installed |
| **Icarus Verilog** | Simulation & Testbench | ✅ Installed |
| **GTKWave** | Waveform Viewer | ✅ Installed |
| **Ngspice** | Circuit Simulation | ✅ Installed |
| **Magic** | Layout & DRC | ✅ Installed |
| **OpenLane** | Complete RTL → GDSII Flow | ✅ Installed |
